# GETVocoder

Description:
The function of this MATLAB code is for the Gaussian-enveloped tone (GET) vocoder. Its theory is firstly detaily introduced in [1].

A Gaussian-enveloped noise (GEN) vocoder can be generate by changing the carrier of GET from tone to noise. The idea of GEN can be found in [2]. A systematic experiment could be found in [2]

Size: ~700 KB

Platform: MATLAB, R2020a or newer versions.

Environment: No requirement.

How to use: 
The GETvoc.m is the main code for GET vocoder introduced in this manuscript. 
Run VocMain.m. A figure will come out and a vocoded sound will be presented.
 
(Note: the code of ACE strategy and spectrogram are from the thirty parties.
The ACE strategy program has been adapted from the CCiMobile program, which can be found at https://github.com/CILabUTD/CCi-MOBILE.)
